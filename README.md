# ReadMeFileGenerator

Using Python we will create a application that enable users to create a detailed ReadMe.md file for any project. 
The app will prompt the user to provide details about their project, and will format their input to create a userfriendly ReadMe.md file. 

##Why##
A well structure ReadMe.md file will enable people to join the project at any stage. It will provide them with an understanding of the project, its objectives as well as some technical requirements users need to know in order to work on the project.
